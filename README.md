### About

I’m interested in how systems are built, how they fail, and how to make them behave.
I prefer learning through hands-on experimentation rather than public noise.

Most of my work lives in private repositories while I learn, break things, and rebuild them properly.

## Areas of Interest

- System design and low-level behaviour  
- Automation and scripting  
- Web fundamentals and interface design  
- Home labbing and self-hosted infrastructure  
- Server setup, configuration, and experimentation  
- Security fundamentals and defensive thinking  

---

## Technical Comfort

**Comfortable with**
- Bash / Zsh
- HTML & CSS
- Linux-based workflows

**Actively learning**
- Python

**Exploring**
- Automation tooling
- Server-side development
- Networking and infrastructure concepts

## Digital Profile

🌐 **Personal site**  
A clean, professional profile showcasing my work style, design approach, and online presence

This site is intentionally minimal and acts as a central hub rather than a project dump.

---

## Current Focus

- Strengthening Python fundamentals through small, deliberate programs  
- Writing cleaner shell scripts for daily workflows  
- Building and maintaining a personal home lab  

---

## Notes

I prefer learning privately, documenting selectively, and publishing when something is solid.
Noise is easy. Craft takes time.
