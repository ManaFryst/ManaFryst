# Hi, I’m Darren 👋

I’m interested in how systems are built, how they fail, and how to make them behave.
My focus is on learning through practical experimentation rather than public noise.

Most of my work lives in private repositories while I learn, break things, and rebuild them properly.

## Areas of Interest

- System design and low-level behaviour  
- Automation and scripting  
- Web fundamentals and interface design  
- Home labbing and self-hosted infrastructure  
- Server setup, configuration, and experimentation  
- Security fundamentals and defensive thinking

## Technical Comfort

**Comfortable with**
- Bash / Zsh
- HTML & CSS
- Linux-based workflows

**Actively learning**
- Python

**Exploring**
- Automation tooling
- Server-side development
- Networking and infrastructure concepts

This site is intentionally minimal and acts as a central hub rather than a project dump.

## Current Focus

- Strengthening Python fundamentals through small, deliberate programs  
- Writing cleaner shell scripts for daily workflows  
- Building and maintaining a personal home lab  
- Learning by maintaining systems rather than chasing flashy demos

## Notes

I prefer learning privately, documenting selectively, and publishing when something is solid.
Noise is easy. Craft takes time.
